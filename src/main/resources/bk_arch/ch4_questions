instances keep shutting down without them issuing shutdown commands. No instance has
run for more than 24 hours without shutting down for some reason. What would you suggest your colleague check to understand why the instances may be shutting down?
A. Make sure that the Cloud Operations agent is installed and collecting metrics.
B. Verify that sufficient persistent storage is attached to the instance.
C. Make sure that the instance availability is not set to preemptible.

7. Your department provides audio transcription services for other departments in your
company. Users upload audio files to a Cloud Storage bucket. Your application transcribes
the audio and writes the transcript file back to the same bucket. Your process runs every day
at midnight and transcribes all files in the bucket. Users are complaining that they are not
notified if there is a problem with the audio file format until the next day. Your application
has a program that can verify the quality of an audio file in less than two seconds. What
changes would you make to the workflow to improve user satisfaction?
A. Include more documentation about what is required to transcribe an audio file successfully.
B. Use Cloud Functions to run the program to verify the quality of the audio file when the
file is uploaded. If there is a problem, notify the user immediately.
C. Create a Compute Engine instance and set up a cron job that runs every hour to check
the quality of files that have been uploaded into the bucket in the last hour. Send notices
to all users who have uploaded files that do not pass the quality control check.
D. Use the App Engine Cron Service to set up a cron job that runs every hour to check the
quality of files that have been uploaded into the bucket in the last hour. Send notices to
all users who have uploaded files that do not pass the quality control check.

8. You have inherited a monolithic C++ application that you need to keep running. There will
be minimal changes, if any, to the code. The previous developer who worked with this application created a Dockerfile and image container with the application and needed libraries.
Youâ€™d like to deploy this in a way that minimizes your effort to maintain it. How would you
deploy this application?
A. Create an instance in Compute Engine, install Docker, install the Cloud Monitoring
agent, and then run the Docker image.
B. Create an instance in Compute Engine, but do not use the Docker image. Install the
application, Ruby, and needed libraries. Install the Cloud Monitoring agent. Run the
application directly in the VM, not a container.
C. Use App Engine Flexible to run the container image. App Engine will monitor as needed.
D. Use App Engine Standard to run the container image. App Engine will monitor as
needed.

9. You have been asked to give a presentation on Kubernetes. How would you explain the
difference between the cluster master and nodes?
A. Cluster masters manage the cluster and run core services such as the controller manager,
API server, scheduler, and etcd. Nodes run workload jobs.
B. The cluster manager is an endpoint for API calls. All services needed to maintain a
cluster are run on nodes.
C. The cluster manager is an endpoint for API calls. All services needed to maintain a
cluster are run on nodes, and workloads are run on a third kind of server, a runner.
D. Cluster masters manage the cluster and run core services such as the controller manager,
API server, scheduler, and etcd. Nodes monitor the cluster master and restart it if it fails.

B. Cloud Monitoring
C. Cloud Dataproc
D. Cloud Memorystore

19. You are receiving alerts that CPU utilization is high on several Compute Engine instances.
The instances are all running a custom C++ application. When you receive these alerts, you
