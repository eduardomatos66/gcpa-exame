{"key": "085", "title": "3. Your organization specializes in helping other companies detect if any pages on their website do not align to the specified standards. To do this, your company has deployed a custom C++ application in your on-premises data centre that crawls all the web pages of a customer\u2019s website, compares the headers and template to the expected standard and stores the result before moving on to another customer\u2019s website. This testing takes a lot of time and has resulted in it missing out on the SLA several times recently. The application team is aware of the slow processing time and wants to run the application on multiple virtual machines to split the load, but there is no free space in the data centre. You have been asked to identify if it is possible to migrate this application to Google cloud, ensuring it can autoscale with minimal changes and reduce the processing time. What GCP service should you recommend?", "alternatives": ["A. Deploy the application on Google App Engine Standard service.", "B. Deploy the application as Cloud Dataproc job based on Hadoop.", "C. Deploy the application on a GCE Managed Instance Group (MIG) with autoscaling enabled.", "D. Deploy the application on a GCE Unmanaged Instance Group. Front the group with a network load balancer."], "answer": "Answer: C"}
