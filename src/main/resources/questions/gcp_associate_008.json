{"key": "008", "title": "8. You have a definition for an instance template that contains a web application. You are asked to deploy the application so that it can scale based on the HTTP traffic it receives. What should you do?", "alternatives": ["A. Create a VM from the instance template. Create a custom image from the VM\u2019s disk. Export the image to Cloud Storage. Create an HTTP load balancer and add the Cloud Storage bucket as its backend service.", "B. Create a VM from the instance template. Create an App Engine application in Automatic Scaling mode that forwards all traffic to the VM.", "C. Create a managed instance group based on the instance template. Configure autoscaling based on HTTP traffic and configure the instance group as the backend service of an HTTP load balancer.", "D. Create the necessary amount of instances required for peak user traffic based on the instance template. Create an unmanaged instance group and add the instances to that instance group. Configure the instance group as the Backend Service of an HTTP load balancer."], "answer": "Answer: C is correct because a managed instance group can use an instance template to scale based on HTTP traffic. - https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/#managed_instance_groups_and_autoscaling - https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/export-image - https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/adding-a-backend-bucket-to-content-based-load-balancing"}
