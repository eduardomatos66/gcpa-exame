{"key": "303", "title": "46. Your production Compute workloads are running in a small subnet with a netmask 225.225.225.224. A recent surge in traffic has seen the production VMs struggle, but there are no free IP addresses for the Managed Instances Group (MIG) to autoscale. You anticipate requiring 30 additional IP addresses for the new VMs. All VMs within the subnet need to communicate with each other, and you want to do this without adding additional routes. What should you do?", "alternatives": ["A. Create a new subnet with a bigger non-overlapping range. Move all instances to the new subnet and delete the old subnet.", "B. Expand the subnet IP range.", "C. Create a new project and a new VPC. Share the new VPC with the existing project and configure all existing resources to use the new VPC.", "D. Create a new subnet with a bigger overlapping range to automatically move all instances to the new subnet. Then, delete the old subnet."], "answer": "Answer: B"}
