{"key": "267", "title": "12. There has been an increased phishing email activity recently, and you deployed a new application on a GKE cluster to help scan and detect viruses in uploaded files. Each time the Finance or HR department receive an email with an attachment, they use this application to scan the email attachment for viruses. The application pods open the email attachment in a sandboxed environment before initiating a virus scan. Some infected email attachments may run arbitrary phishing code with elevated privileges in the container. You want to ensure that the pods that run these scans do not impact pods of other applications running in the same GKE cluster. How can you achieve this isolation between pods?", "alternatives": ["A. Detect vulnerabilities in the application container images in GCR repo by using the Container Analysis API.", "B. Create a new (non-default) node pool with sandbox type set to gvisor and configure the deployment spec with a runtimeClassName of gvisor.", "C. Configure the pods to use containerd as the runtime by adding a node selector with key: cloud.google.com/gke-os-distribution and value:cos_containerd.", "D. Have your applications use trusted container images by enabling Binary Authorization."], "answer": "Answer: B"}
