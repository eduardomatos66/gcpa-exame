{"key": "205", "title": "41. You deployed a java application in a single Google Cloud Compute Engine VM. During peak usage, the application CPU is maxed out and results in stuck threads which ultimately make the system unresponsive, and requires a reboot. Your operations team want to receive an email alert when the CPU utilization is greater than 95% for more than 10 minutes so they can manually change the instance type to another instance that offers more CPU. What should you do?", "alternatives": ["A. Link the GCP project to a Cloud Monitoring workspace. Configure an Alerting policy based on CPU utilization in Cloud Monitoring and trigger an email notification when the utilization exceeds the threshold.", "B. Write a custom script to monitor CPU usage and send an email notification when the usage exceeds the threshold.", "C. In Cloud Logging, create logs based metric for CPU usage and store it as a custom metric in Cloud Monitoring. Create an Alerting policy based on CPU utilization in Cloud Monitoring and trigger an email notification when the utilization exceeds the threshold.", "D. Link the project to a Cloud Monitoring workspace. Write a custom script that captures CPU utilization every minute and sends to Cloud Monitoring as a custom metric. Add an uptime check based on the CPU utilization."], "answer": "Answer: A"}
