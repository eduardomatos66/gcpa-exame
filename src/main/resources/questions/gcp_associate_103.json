{"key": "103", "title": "24. You recently deployed a new application in Google App Engine to serve production traffic. After analyzing logs for various user flows, you uncovered several issues in your application code and have developed a fix to address the issues. Parts of your proposed fix could not be validated in the pre-production environment by your testing team as some of the scenarios can only be validated by an end-user with access to specific data in your production environment. In the company\u2019s weekly Change Approval Board meeting, concerns were raised that the fix could possibly take down the application. It was unanimously agreed that while the fix is risky, it is a necessary change to the application. You have been asked to suggest a solution that minimizes the impact of the change going wrong. You also want to minimize costs. What should you do?", "alternatives": ["A. Set up a second Google App Engine service, and then update a subset of clients to hit the new service.", "B. Deploy the new application version temporarily, capture logs and then roll it back to the previous version.", "C. Deploy a new version of the application, and use traffic splitting to send a small percentage of traffic to it.", "D. Create a second Google App Engine project with the new application code, and onboard users gradually to the new application."], "answer": "Answer: C"}
