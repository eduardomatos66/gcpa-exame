Although the scaling works, it is not quick enough, and users experience slow response times. The solution architect has recommended moving to GKE to achieve faster scaling and optimize machine resource utilization. Your colleague containerized the application and provided you with a Dockerfile. You now need to deploy this in a GKE cluster. How should you do it?", "alternatives": ["A.
