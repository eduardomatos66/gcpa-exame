The game backend APIs runs on a fleet of VMs behind a Managed Instance Group (MIG) with autoscaling enabled. You have configured the scaling policy on the MIG to add more instances if the CPU utilization is consistently over 85%, and to scale down when the CPU utilization is consistently lower than 65%. You noticed the autoscaler adds more VMs than is necessary during the scale-up, and you suspect this might be down to an incorrect configuration in the health check \u2013 the initial delay on the health check is 30 seconds. Each VM takes just under 3 minutes before it is ready to process the requests from the web application and mobile app. What should you do to fix the scaling issue?", "alternatives": ["A. Update the Managed Instances template to set the maximum instances to 5.", "B. Update the Managed Instances template to set the maximum instances to 1.", "C.
