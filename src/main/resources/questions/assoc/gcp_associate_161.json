{"key": "161", "title": "41. You have two workloads on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) \u2013 create-order and dispatch-order. create-order handles the creation of customer orders, and dispatch- order handles dispatching orders to your shipping partner. Both create-order and dispatch-order workloads have cluster autoscaling enabled. The create-order deployment needs to access (i.e. invoke web service of) dispatch-order deployment. dispatch-order deployment cannot be exposed publicly. How should you define the services?", "alternatives": ["A. Create a Service of type ClusterlP for dispatch-order. Have create- order use the Service IP address.", "B. Create a Service of type LoadBalancer for dispatch-order and an Ingress S Resource for that Service. Have create-order use the Ingress IP address.", "C. Create a Service of type LoadBalancer for dispatch-order. Have create-order use the Service IP address.", "D. Create a Service of type NodePort for dispatch-order and an Ingress Resource for that Service. Have create-order use the Ingress IP address."], "answer": "Answer: A"}
