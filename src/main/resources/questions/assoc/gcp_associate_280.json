{"key": "280", "title": "24. Your colleague is learning about docker images, containers and Kubernetes, and has recently deployed a sample application to a GKE You deployed a demo application on a GKE cluster that uses preemptible nodes. The deployment has 2 replicas, and although the demo application is responding to requests, the output from Cloud Shell shows one of the pods is pending state.1kubectl get pods -1 app=demoWhat is the most likely explanation for this behaviour?", "alternatives": ["A. The pod in the pending state is unable to download the docker image.", "B. The node got preempted before the pod could be started fully. GKE cluster master is provisioning a new node.", "C. The pod in the pending state is too big to fit on a single preemptible VM. The node pool needs to be recreated with a bigger machine type.", "D. Cluster autoscaling is not enabled, and the existing (only) node doesn\u2019t have enough resources for provisioning the pod."], "answer": "Answer: D"}
