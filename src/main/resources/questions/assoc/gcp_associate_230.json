Update the access control on daily-us-customer-export Cloud Storage bucket to make it public. Create a subfolder inside the bucket with a randomized name and have the compute engine instance push objects to this folder.", "B. Ensure both the projects are in the same GCP folder in the resource hierarchy.", "C. Grant the service account used by the compute engine in app-tier GCP project roles/storage.objectCreator IAM role on the daily-us-customer-export Cloud Storage bucket.", "D.
