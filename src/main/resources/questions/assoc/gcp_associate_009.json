{"key": "009", "title": "9. You are creating a Kubernetes Engine cluster to deploy multiple pods inside the cluster. All container logs must be stored in BigQuery for later analysis. You want to follow Google-recommended practices. Which two approaches can you take?E. Use the Stackdriver Logging export feature to create a sink to BigQuery. Specify a filter expression to export log records related to your Kubernetes Engine cluster only.", "alternatives": ["A. Turn on Stackdriver Logging during the Kubernetes Engine cluster creation.", "B. Turn on Stackdriver Monitoring during the Kubernetes Engine cluster creation.", "C. Develop a custom add-on that uses Cloud Logging API and BigQuery API. Deploy the add-on to your Kubernetes Engine cluster.", "D. Use the Stackdriver Logging export feature to create a sink to Cloud Storage. Create a Cloud Dataflow job that imports log files from Cloud Storage to BigQuery."], "answer": "Answer: A Is correct because creating a cluster with Stackdriver Logging option will enable all the container logs to be stored in Stackdriver Logging. - E Is correct because Stackdriver Logging support exporting logs to BigQuery by creating sinks - https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/logging - https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2 - https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/"}
