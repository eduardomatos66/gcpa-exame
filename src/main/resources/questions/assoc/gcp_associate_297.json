How can you ensure the LDAP server is publicly reachable via TLS on UDP port 636?", "alternatives": ["A. Configure a firewall rule to allow inbound (ingress) UDP traffic on port 636 from 0.0.0.0/0 for the network tag allow-inbound-udp-636, and add this network tag to the LDAP server Compute Engine Instance.", "B. Configure a firewall rule to allow outbound (egress) UDP traffic on port 636 to 0.0.0.0/0 for the network tag allow-outbound-udp-636, and add this network tag to the LDAP server Compute Engine Instance.", "C. Add default-allow-udp network tag to the LDAP server Compute Engine Instance.", "D. Configure a firewall route called default-allow-udp and have the next hop as the LDAP server Compute Engine Instance."], "answer": "Answer: A"}
