{"key": "294", "title": "38. Your company wants to move all its on-premises applications to Google Cloud. Most applications depend on Kubernetes orchestration, and you have chosen to deploy these applications in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). The security team have requested you to store all container images in a Google Container Registry (GCR) in a separate project which has an automated vulnerability management scanning set up by a security partner organization. You want to ensure the GKE cluster running in your project can download the container images from the central GCR repo in the other project. How should you do this?", "alternatives": ["A. Grant the Storage Object Viewer IAM role on the GCR Repo project to the service account used by GKE nodes in your project.", "B. Update ACLs on each container image to provide read-only access to the service account used by GKE nodes in your project.", "C. Enable full access to all Google APIs under Access Scopes when provisioning the GKE cluster.", "D. In the central GCR repo project, grant the Storage Object Viewer role on the Cloud Storage bucket that contains the container images to a service account and generate a P12 key for this service account. Configure the Kubernetes service account to use this key for imagePullSecrets."], "answer": "Answer: A"}
