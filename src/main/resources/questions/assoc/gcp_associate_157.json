{"key": "157", "title": "38. Your company runs several internal applications on bare metal Kubernetes servers in your on-premises data centre. One of the applications deployed in the Kubernetes cluster uses a NAS share to save files. In preparation for the upcoming migration to Google Cloud, you want to update the application to use Google Cloud Storage instead; however, security policies prevent virtual machines from having public IP addresses. What should you do?", "alternatives": ["A. Configure a VPN tunnel between the on-premises data centre and the GCP VPC. Create a custom route in the VPC for Google Restricted APIs IP range (199.36.153.4/30) and propagate the route over VPN. Resolve *.googleapis.com as a CNAME record to restricted.googleapis.com in your on-premises DNS server.", "B. Make an exception and assign public IP addresses to the servers. Configure firewall rules to allow traffic from the VM public IP addresses to the IP range of Cloud Storage.", "C. Create a new VPC in GCP and deploy a proxy server like HAProxy/Squid to forward requests to Cloud Storage. Configure a VPN tunnel between the on- premises data centre and the GCP VPC. Have the servers access Cloud Storage through the proxy.", "D. Migrate all VMs from the data centre to Google Compute Engine. Set up a Load Balancer on the GCP bucket and have the servers access Cloud Storage through the load balancer."], "answer": "Answer: A"}
