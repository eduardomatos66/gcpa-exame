{"key": "011", "title": "11. You have an application server running on Compute Engine in the europe-west1-d zone. You need to ensure high availability and replicate the server to the europe-west2-c zone using the fewest steps possible. What should you do?", "alternatives": ["A. Create a snapshot from the disk. Create a disk from the snapshot in the europe-west2-c zone. Create a new VM with that disk.", "B. Create a snapshot from the disk. Create a disk from the snapshot in the europe-west1-d zone and then move the disk to europe-west2-c. Create a new VM with that disk.", "C. Use \u201cgcloud\u201d to copy the disk to the europe-west2-c zone. Create a new VM with that disk.", "D.
