{"key": "304", "title": "47. Your runs several applications on the production GKE cluster. The machine learning team runs their training models in the default GKE cluster node pool, but the processing is slower and is delaying their analysis. You want the ML jobs to run on NVIDIA\u00ae Tesla R K80: nvidia-tesla-k80 GPU for better performance and increased throughput. What should you do?", "alternatives": ["A. Create a new GPU enabled node pool with the required specification, and configure node selector on the pods with key: cloud.google.com/gke-accelerator and value: nvidia-tesla-k80.", "B. Create a dedicated GKE cluster with GPU enabled node pool as per the required specifications, and migrate the ML jobs to the new cluster.", "C. Add a metadata tag to the pod specification with key: accelerator and value: tesla-gpu.", "D. Terminate all existing nodes in the node pools and create new nodes with the required GPUs attached."], "answer": "Answer: A"}
