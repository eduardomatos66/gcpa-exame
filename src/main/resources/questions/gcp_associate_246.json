{"key": "246", "title": "34. You deployed an application on a general-purpose Google Cloud Compute Engine instance that uses a persistent zonal SSD of 300 GB. The application downloads large Apache AVRO files from Cloud Storage, retrieve customer details from them and saves a text file on local disk for each customer before pushing all the text files to a Google Storage Bucket. These operations require high disk I/O, but you find that the read and write operations on the disk are always throttled. What should you do to improve the throughput while keeping costs to a minimum?", "alternatives": ["A. Bump up the size of its SSD persistent disk to 1 TB.", "B. Replace Zonal Persistent SSD with a Local SSD.", "C. Replace Zonal Persistent SSD with a Regional Persistent SSD.", "D. Bump up the CPU allocated to the general-purpose Compute Engine instance."], "answer": "Answer: B"}
