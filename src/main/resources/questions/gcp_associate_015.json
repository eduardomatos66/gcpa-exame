{"key": "015", "title": "15. You have created a Kubernetes deployment, called Deployment-A, with 3 replicas on your cluster. Another deployment, called Deployment-B, needs access to Deployment-A. You cannot expose Deployment-A outside of the cluster. What should you do?", "alternatives": ["A. Create a Service of type NodePort for Deployment A and an Ingress Resource for that Service. Have Deployment B use the Ingress IP address.", "B. Create a Service of type LoadBalancer for Deployment A. Have Deployment B use the Service IP address.", "C. Create a Service of type LoadBalancer for Deployment A and an Ingress Resource for that Service. Have Deployment B use the Ingress IP address.", "D. Create a Service of type ClusterIP for Deployment A. Have Deployment B use the Service IP address."], "answer": "Answer: D is correct because this exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP address. Choosing this method makes the service reachable only from within the cluster. - https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/"}
