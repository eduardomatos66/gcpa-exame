{"key": "117", "title": "38. You developed a web application that lets users upload and share images. You deployed this application in Google Compute Engine and you have configured Stackdriver Logging. Your application sometimes times out while uploading large images, and your application generates relevant error log entries that are ingested to Stackdriver Logging. You would now like to create alerts based on these metrics. You intend to add more compute resources manually when the number of failures exceeds a threshold. What should you do in order to alert based on these metrics with minimal effort?", "alternatives": ["A. Add the Stackdriver monitoring and logging agent to the instances running the code.", "B. In Stackdriver logging, create a new logging metric with the required filters, edit the application code to set the metric value when needed, and create an alert in Stackdriver based on the new metric.", "C. In Stackdriver Logging, create a custom monitoring metric from log data and create an alert in Stackdriver based on the new metric.", "D. Create a custom monitoring metric in code, edit the application code to set the metric value when needed, create an alert in Stackdriver based on the new metric."], "answer": "Answer: C"}
